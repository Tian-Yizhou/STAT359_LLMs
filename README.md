## 📁 Repository Structure

- `instructor/` — Official course materials, homework assignments, and resources (provided by instructors).
- `student/` — Your own work: homework solutions, project code, and notes. **All your submissions should go here.**
- `.md` files — Setup and environment guides to help you get started on your laptop or on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Set Up Your Repo
- **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
- **Add the instructor and TA as collaborators** to your forked repo.
- **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
- **Sync regularly** with the upstream (instructor's) repo to get updates:
  ```sh
  git remote add upstream <instructor-repo-url>
  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/main
  ```

### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment
- **Follow the setup guides:**
  - [`venv_setup.md`](./venv_setup.md): Set up a Python virtual environment using Poetry.
  

- **Recommended IDE:** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 💻 Local vs. Cloud Development

- **Local Development:**
  - Do most of your coding, debugging, and preliminary testing on your laptop.
  - If your laptop has a suitable GPU (NVIDIA or Apple M-series), you can complete most assignments locally.

- **Cloud (GCP) Development:**
  - For large models or heavy computation, use a GCP GPU instance.
  - Two ways to use GCP:
    1. **Code Locally, Run Remotely:**
       - Push your code to GitHub, then SSH into your GCP instance and run scripts from the command line.
    2. **VS Code Remote SSH:**
       - [`install_gcp.md`](./install_gcp.md): Set up a GCP GPU instance (if needed).
       - [`dev_gcp.md`](./dev_gcp.md): Develop on GCP using VS Code Remote SSH.
       - Use the Remote - SSH extension to develop directly on the GCP instance with the full power of VS Code.

## 📝 Homework & Collaboration

- **Instructor posts materials and assignments** in the `instructor/` folder.
- **Students work in the `student/` folder** and submit assignments there.
- **Keep your repo up to date** by syncing with the upstream instructor repo.
